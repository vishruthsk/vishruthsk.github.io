Centralisation of “decentralised” internet

Web3, also known as the decentralized web, has been hailed as the next generation of the internet, one that is free from the centralization and censorship that plagues the current web. However, as promising as this vision may be, there are some who argue that the decentralized internet is more myth than reality.

One major issue with the decentralized web is that many of the infrastructure providers that support it, rely on centralized servers and infrastructure. This means that if these servers go down, it can have a major impact on the entire Web3 ecosystem. For example, in 2020, Infura experienced a major downtime, causing widespread disruptions for Ethereum-based applications and services.

Another issue is that, despite its promise of decentralization, Web3 is often dependent on a few key players. For example, Ethereum is currently the dominant platform for building decentralized applications, and a small number of large mining pools control a significant portion of the network’s hash rate. This concentration of power can make it difficult for smaller players to effectively participate in the Web3 ecosystem.

Node as a Service(NaaS) platforms — node providers or tool builders?

Many of the node-as-a-service platforms that support the decentralized web are not actually building any sort of decentralized network. These platforms are tool builders, they use centralized infrastructure providers such as AWS to host their nodes and then build tools and APIs around them, making decentralised applications operate on a centralised environment.

So, is the decentralized internet a myth? It’s certainly true that Web3 has a long way to go before it can truly be considered a decentralized platform. However, projects like Viper Network are working to address some of these issues.

Viper Network

Viper Network is a new RPC relay protocol for Web3 that serves node-as-a-service platforms and incentivizes them in return for sending traffic to its network. This helps to decentralize the infrastructure of Web3 and makes it more resilient to outages and disruptions.

One of the key benefits of Viper Network is that it allows the web3 community to achieve decentralisation at a faster pace through node-as-a-service platforms and it allows these platforms to reach a larger customer base by supporting multiple blockchains and allowing them to focus more on tools built around rather than maintaining their own nodes, which can help to promote decentralization within the Web3 ecosystem. By providing these platforms with a way to expand their reach and generate revenue, Viper Network can help to level the playing field and make it easier for smaller players to participate in Web3.

In summary, while the decentralized internet may not yet be a reality, Viper Network is working to address some of the issues that have held back the decentralized web. By promoting decentralization and resilience within the Web3 ecosystem, Viper Network wants to help fulfil Web3’s promise of building a truly decentralized internet.
